# SafeDrop
SafeDrop is a Spigot plugin that allows players to safely drop items while protecting their inventory from accidental item drops.

## Features
* SafeDrop only allows players to drop items if they confirm the action, preventing accidental item drops.
* Admins can enable or disable SafeDrop for individual players or for the entire server.
* Players can turn SafeDrop on or off themselves.
* SafeDrop is fully customizable with text and action bar messages.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of SafeDrop from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/safedrop-safely-drop-items.72585/).
2. Move the downloaded .jar file to your server's "plugins" folder.
3. Restart your server.

## Usage
To use SafeDrop, simply drop an item as you normally would. If SafeDrop is enabled for your player, a confirmation message will be displayed in the chat and/or action bar. You can then confirm or cancel the item drop. To turn SafeDrop on or off, use the /safedrop on or /safedrop off command.

For admins, the /safedrop reload command can be used to reload the SafeDrop configuration file, and the /safedrop reportbug command can be used to report bugs or issues with the plugin.

## Configuration
The SafeDrop configuration file can be found at plugins/SafeDrop/config.yml. The file can be edited to customize SafeDrop's messages and settings.
